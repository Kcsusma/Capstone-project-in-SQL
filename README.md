This project focuses on designing and managing an airline database using SQL to optimize data storage and retrieval:

1. Database Design: Created and normalized relational database tables for flights, passengers, bookings, and routes, ensuring data integrity with primary and foreign keys.
2. Complex Queries: Performed SQL operations like joins and aggregate functions to extract insights and generate reports for better decision-making.
3. Data Integrity: Enforced data accuracy by applying constraints and ensuring referential integrity through normalization techniques.
4. Optimization: Created indexes to optimize query performance, ensuring faster data retrieval and efficient analysis of large datasets.

   
This project demonstrates my proficiency in SQL for designing databases, running complex queries, and optimizing systems for large-scale airline operations.
